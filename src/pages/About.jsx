        <p>
          Hello world! I'm Charles Hunter, a full stack web developer with a passion for clean code, engaging UI/UX, and solving real-world problems with technology. I enjoy building apps that combine functionality with creativity. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I develop as both a hobby as well as a career, and I love the challenge of learning new technologies and frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am an aspiring student in full stack development and spend time exploring techniques like MERN stack, RESTful APIs, and deployment workflows. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to keep learning, growing, and ultimately contribute to projects that make a positive impact. 
        </p>
        <p>
          On the hobby side, I enjoy working on personal projects that allow me to experiment with new technologies and frameworks such as game development, sound engineering and video editing. I love to produce music, write poetry, write stories and spending time with my family and friends is a priority of mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my development journey, I've gained hands-on experience with a variety of languages and tools. On the frontend, I've worked with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and React to build dynamic and responsive user interfaces. 
        </p>
        <p>
          On the backend, I've developed RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express, and I've used PostgreSQL and MongoDB for managing data. I've also incorporated technologies like Sequelize and Mongoose for database modeling, and I'm comfortable using Git, GitHub, and CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions and CircleCI for version control and deployment workflows. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, I've deployed full-stack applications using platforms like Netlify and Render.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am always eager to learn and grow as a developer, and I'm excited about the opportunities that are in store for me. If you're interested in collaborating on a project or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!
